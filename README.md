# Docker Poetry

Docker Poetry is a Docker image for Python projects with dependencies managed by Poetry.

![Poetry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Poetry-1.8.0-purple) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12%20(default)%20%7C%203.11%20%7C%203.10%20%7C%203.9%20%7C%203.8-blue) ![Variants](https://img.shields.io/badge/Variants-Bookworm%20(default)%20%7C%20Slim-orange
)

## Why

At <a href="https://withlogic.co/">LOGIC</a> our go-to stack for web applications is; the latest LTS Django on the latest Python using Poetry as our dependency manager in Docker. [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is a core principle for us, so a public Docker image with the right Python and Poetry version is an exceptional base for new projects.

## Tags

For the simplest use case just pick your Poetry version:

```
ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:<poetry_version>
```

This will use the default Python version (latest) and image variant (Bookworm). You can be more specific by picking either a Python version, image variant or both:

- Python version: `ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:<poetry_version>-python-<python_version>`
- Image variant: `ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:<poetry_version>-<image_variant>`
- Python version and image variant: `ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:<poetry_version>-python-<python_version>-<image_variant>`

### Examples

- Poetry 1.8.0: `ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:1.8.0`
- Poetry 1.8.0 on Python 3.12: `ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:1.8.0-python-3.12`
- Poetry 1.8.0 on Bookworm: `ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:1.8.0-bookworm`
- Poetry 1.8.0 on Python 3.12 and Bookworm: `ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:1.8.0-python-3.12-bookworm`

## Usage

First, pick the image tag you wish to use. Then, copy your `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files in the working directory (`/usr/src/app`), for optimal caching and run `poetry install`. Example:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:1.8.0

COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry install

COPY ./ ./
```

## Supported versions
