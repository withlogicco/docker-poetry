# Docker Poetry

Docker Poetry is a Docker image for Python projects with dependencies managed by Poetry.

![Poetry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Poetry-1.1.13-purple) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10%20(default)%20%7C%203.9%20%7C%203.8%20%7C%203.7-blue) ![OS](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-Debian%20(default)%20%7C%20Slim%20%7C%20Alpine-orange
)
## Why

At <a href="https://withlogic.co/">LOGIC</a> our go-to stack for web applications is; the latest LTS Django on the latest Python using Poetry as our dependency manager in Docker. [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is a core principle for us, so a public Docker image with the right Python and Poetry version is an exceptional base for new projects.

## Usage

Just pick the Poetry version you wish to use and optionally also a Python version and OS.

```
ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:<poetry_version>-python-<python_version>-<os_variant>
```

For example, if you want to use Poetry 1.1.13 with Python 3.10 (default) on Debian (default) in your Dockerfile, you would do the following:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:1.1.13
```

If you do the same, with Python 3.8 on Debian Slim you would do the following:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/withlogicco/poetry:1.1.13-python-3.8-slim
```

## Supported versions

### Poetry

Only the latest version of Poetry is included in each build.

### Python (optional)

A build will be provided for each Python version still under maintenance and support. The latest Python version acts as the default in each build.
